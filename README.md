# TCDS Smart Surveillance

TCDS Smart Surveillance is an innovative project developed as part of the Galgotias Hackathon 2022. This project provides a comprehensive surveillance solution incorporating advanced technologies like facial recognition and object detection, all built and run within a Jupyter Notebook.

## Key Features

- **Facial Recognition**: Real-time identification of individuals to enhance security.
- **Object Detection**: Identifies objects in the surveillance feed for activity monitoring.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Utilizes Jupyter Notebook for an interactive and easy-to-use development and testing environment.
- **Data Analysis**: Includes data management and analysis with libraries such as Pandas.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language used for the system.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For developing, testing, and running the system in an interactive environment.
- **OpenCV**: Performs image processing and video capture for surveillance.
- **TensorFlow**: Powers facial recognition and object detection models with machine learning.
- **Facial Recognition Libraries**: Used for identifying individuals in real-time.

## Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the TCDS Smart Surveillance system:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mridulgoel03/TCDS-Smart-Survillance.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd TCDS-Smart-Survillance
   ```

3. **Install the Required Libraries**:
   Make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   Start Jupyter Notebook from the project directory:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. **Open the Notebook**:
   In Jupyter, navigate to and open `TCDS_Surveillance.ipynb`.

6. **Run the Cells**:
   Run the cells sequentially to initialize the system, load the models, and start facial recognition and object detection from your camera feed.

## Example Workflow

- Run the first few cells to load the necessary libraries and set up the environment.
- Continue by running the facial recognition and object detection models.
- The output will show the surveillance feed in real-time with identified faces and detected objects.
